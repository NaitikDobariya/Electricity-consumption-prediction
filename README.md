# Electricity-consumption-prediction

### Electricity Demand Prediction

In this repo, we test XGBoost and Prophet for forecasting tasks. This project utilizes the XGBoost and Facebook Prophet libraries to forecast electricity demand trends.

#### Project Overview

Within this repository, you will find comprehensive steps undertaken to predict electricity demand. These steps include:

- Data visualization to gain insights into the underlying patterns and trends.
- Exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution and characteristics of the dataset.
- Feature creation from existing dataset features to enhance model performance.
- Data preprocessing to ensure data quality and suitability for modeling.
- Segmentation of predictions into yearly, monthly, and daily trends for a nuanced understanding of demand dynamics.

#### Libraries Used

- pandas
- numpy
- datetime
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- xgboost
- Prophet

#### Results

**XGBoost:**

In this notebook, we trained an XGBoost model on our dataset and achieved a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 1.37% and an R2 score of 0.592.

**Prophet:**

Similarly, we utilized the Prophet library to train a model, obtaining a MAPE of 3.92% and an R2 score of 0.546.

#### R2 Score Graphs

Please find below the graphs depicting the R2 scores for both XGBoost and Prophet models.
